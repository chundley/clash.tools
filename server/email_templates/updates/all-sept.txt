Hi [ign],

I hope you are enjoying clash.tools, and especially hope you are continuing to play Clash of Clans!

I've been a big supporter of the community for about three years now, most importantly the contribution of clash.tools - now with more than 5,000 clans registered and the best choice for managing clan wars.

Allow me to divert your attention away from the game for a brief moment.

For the last few months you may have noticed I've been relatively absent from the BAND support group and the Supercell forums. Earlier this year I was diagnosed with Skin cancer - right in the middle of my nose of all places!

As many of you know, the timing for this kind of thing couldn't have been worse. I've been working the last two years on a startup here in Seattle that's just now starting to gain some traction. I've put everything I had into it, drained my savings and retirement accounts to support it.

This would have been all great, except for the recent medical issues. Since I've been running my own business, my health insurance is barebones (ie, not that great).

I'm happy to report that officially this week I'm cancer free!</b> While this is great news for me and my family, the unfortunate reality is I've needed multiple facial reconstruction surgeries to account for the skin that had to be taken from my nose.

I consider the clash community part of my extended family and decided to reach out for help. I know many of you have already kindly donated to support the cost of running clash.tools and keeping it free for everyone - and I know everyone appreciates that (most of all me)!

I'm not one to ask for charity so this is a little strange for me - but if you are still enjoying clash.tools I'm officially holding out the soup can.

If you have a spare $5 laying around and feel particularly generous today, you'd be making a huge difference for me and my family.

Thanks in advance from the bottom of my heart for anything you can do to help - and clash on!
