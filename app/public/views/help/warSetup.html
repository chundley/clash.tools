                <p>Almost everything you do in clash.tools revolves around an active war. Only one war can be active at a time, and only attacks in the active war can be updated.</p>
                <p>A new war can't be created and activated until an existing war has been ended. When a war is ended, it's de-activated and the attack statistics are logged permanently.</p>

                <p>Use this section to configure who from your clan is participating in this war, and what order the bases are in. Only members specified on the roster will be able to reserve targets.</p>
                <p>If members have configured their profiles, their town hall level will automatically be selected. If not, you'll have to select their TH level. Dropdowns left in red after you've set the roster are the ones you need to change by hand. This has a dramatic impact on <a href="/help/av">Attack Value</a> so it's worthwhile to make sure these are set correctly.</p>
                <p>In addition, if a member has set one or both hero upgrade timers you'll see that in the "Heroes Down" column. This helps if your clan leaders assign bases because they can drop someone down to a lower base if a hero is upgrading.</p>
                <p><b>Placeholders</b>: the last member in the dropdown list is labeled "Placeholder". If you have a clan member who hasn't joined clash.tools yet you can add placeholder text for them in the roster. Please note that I <b>strongly discourage you from doing this</b>. Adding a placeholder is a last resort if you have a member who won't sign up for an account. You'll have to do this for them on every war going forward, and none of their stats will be tracked. In clash.tools it is always better to get everyone in your clan to register. This is covered in more detail in the walkthrough video above.</p>

                <p>In this section you'll set the opponent town hall levels. If you wish to assign your members their first target, you can also do that here. Once the war starts you can't assign targets in this interface - you can do that through the "Bases" screen.</p>
                <p>You'll notice an option in the instructions called <b>Cascade TH changes</b>. In a large war it's a pain to select the TH level of every opponent base. In most wars, bases generally sort from top to bottom with highest townhall's at the top. With this option selected, every base below the number you are changing will switch to that same TH level. For example, if you set base #1 to TH10, all townhalls become TH10. Now if you change base #11 to TH9, all bases below #11 will change to TH9. In most wars this means you only have to select between 2 and 5 dropdowns, rather than 50.</p>
