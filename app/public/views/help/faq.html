                <p>Clash.tools (CT) is a web application built from the ground up to take the best features of other tools such as Clash Caller and Clash of Clans War Planner and combine them to create an elegant, fluid experience for managing clan wars.</p>

                <p>Casual war clans who aren't worried about security. For example, Clash Caller is great for casual war clans due to it's simplicity - but it's open nature means anyone can do anything, and there's no way to know who did what. This presents a significant problem when a less-than-trustworthy member decides to change all of your names and assignments for fun.</p>
                <p>If your clan is opposed to creating member accounts to help manage wars and track statistics over time securly, clash.tools is not for you.</p>

                <p>Each account in clash.tools requires a different email address. Whether your COC accounts are in different clans or not doesn't matter - you'll need a new email address for each CT account.</p>
                <p>The easiest way to do this without driving yourself crazy with so many email addresses is use Gmail and the "fake alias" feature. <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/12096?hl=en" target="_blank">Click here for Google's explanation</a>.</p>
                <p>For a real world example, let's say my email address is aaa@gmail.com. I have two COC accounts, one is minpin and one is billybob. I can create two clash.tools accounts with email addresses aaa@gmail.com and aaa+billy@gmail.com. Any email sent to either of these addresses goes to my normal aaa@gmail.com inbox. You can create as many of these as you want - any text after the '+' sign is basically ignored by Gmail.</p>
