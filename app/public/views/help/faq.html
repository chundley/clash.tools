                <p>Casual war clans who aren't worried about security. For example, Clash Caller is great for casual war clans due to it's simplicity - but it's open nature means anyone can do anything, and there's no way to know who did what. This presents a significant problem when a less-than-trustworthy member decides to change all of your names and assignments for fun.</p>
                <p>If your clan is opposed to creating member accounts to help manage wars and track statistics over time securly, clash.tools is not for you.</p>
