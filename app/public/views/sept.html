                                        <p>I hope you are enjoying clash.tools, and especially hope you are continuing to play Clash of Clans!</p>
                                        <p>I've been a big supporter of the community for about three years now, most importantly the contribution of clash.tools - now with more than 5,000 clans registered and the best choice for managing clan wars.</p>
                                        <p><b>Allow me to divert your attention away from the game for a brief moment.</b></p>
                                        <p>For the last few months you may have noticed I've been relatively absent from the BAND support group and the Supercell forums. Earlier this year I was diagnosed with Skin cancer - right in the middle of my nose of all places!</p>
                                        <p>As many of you know, the timing for this kind of thing couldn't have been worse. I've been working the last two years on a startup here in Seattle that's just now starting to gain some traction. I've put everything I had into it, drained my savings and retirement accounts to support it.</p>
                                        <p>This would have been all great, except for the recent medical issues. Since I've been running my own business, my health insurance is barebones (ie, not that great).</p>
                                        <p><b>I'm happy to report that officially this week I'm cancer free!</b> While this is great news for me and my family, the unfortunate reality is I've needed multiple facial reconstruction surgeries to account for the skin that had to be taken from my nose.</p>
                                        <p>I consider the clash community part of my extended family and decided to reach out for help. I know many of you have already kindly donated to support the cost of running clash.tools and keeping it free for everyone - and I know everyone appreciates that (most of all me)!</p>
                                        <p>I'm not one to ask for charity so this is a little strange for me - but if you are still enjoying clash.tools I'm officially holding out the soup can.</p>
                                        <p>If you have a spare $5 laying around and feel particularly generous today, you'd be making a huge difference for me and my family.</p>
                                        <p>Below the donation button I've included a few pictures of my progression - in case any of you are curious about the process.</p>
                                        <p>Thanks in advance from the bottom of my heart for anything you can do to help - and clash on!</p>

                                    <p><b>First surgery</b><p/>
                                    This sounds crazy, but this is actually what they do. The first phase is to make an incision and cut a flap of skin from the forehead down to the bridge of my nose. They then grafted the forehead skin on to my nose to cover the large amount of skin that had to be removed.<br/>

                                        <p><b>Bandage removed</b><p/>
                                        Once I took the bandages off my head the extent of what had to be done was clearer. I looked like Frankenstein for a while. The craziest thing is the skin on my nose was never detached, so anything that touched my nose I actually felt on my forehead.<br/>

                                        <p><b>Second surgery</b><p/>
                                        After several weeks of letting the skin heal (and getting stitches removed), it was time for the second surgery. This time around it was to remove the temporary skin flap and do additional repairs. Getting more back to normal now. Still need a little work on my right eye to straighten it out.<br/>

                                        If all goes well I'll end up back in for some minor adjustments and touchups to make sure that my face looks as normal as possible :)<br/><br/>
